    <div class="about personalStatement">
        <p>
            The quote above by a Stanford University professor urged students to proactively contribute, and not be confined to what he is told to do. It left a deep impression on me. I am an undergraduate reading Industrial and Systems Engineering at the National University of Singapore and will be graduating in one year. I hope to embody the attitude when contributing at my internship and enrich myself. 
        </p>
        <p class="cover-title">A little about myself.</p>
        <p>
            I would like to think that I am a proactive person. I have initiated many things with friends and these collective experiences in leading and managing events have taught me how to work with people and resources, and especially how to work efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also highly driven. I like to spend my free time upgrading myself because I feel good when I make full use of my time. I recently took interest in self-learning French and programming in iOS. I can now read simple french and create simple iPhone apps.
        </p>
        <p class="cover-title">The agenda.</p>
        <p>
            I am proactive and highly driven character-wise, and technically good at management and analytics. I seek an internship that will give me good exposure to responsibilities and networking opportunity. I am also open to opportunities to work abroad in the future, if there is any.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope that my personal skills and experience, coupled with the tenacity to learn, helps me contribute immensely and bring valuable service to the customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am available every day. It is best to contact me by phone or mail during office hours. Please find my contacts in the contacts page.
